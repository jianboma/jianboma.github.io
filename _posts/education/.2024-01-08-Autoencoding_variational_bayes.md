# Variational auto-encoder
Paper link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)<br>

## TL;DR
The variational auto-encoder was proposed in the paper <d-cite key="kingma2013auto"></d-cite>
<details>
<summary>some logs</summary>
I think there are still more motivations and insights of the proposed the SSM that can be digged. How is it linked with the neural network and deep learning should be explored more. At least at this stage (reading this paper and relevant papers), <b>I do not have a good understanding about the SSM and its link to neural networks.</b><br>

The connection between continuous-time SSM to discrete-time SSM, trade-off, limitations, properties are assumed to be discussed in previous literatures, such as this one <d-cite key="tustin1947method"></d-cite> cited in paper. But it may not be that critical.<br>

What is the kind of inductive bias that the model introduced? <br>

<b>Another question is that why the original discrete-time SSM does not have a same computational problem.</b> Why does not original discreate-time SSM propose the efficient algorithm? What are the differences between the discrete-time SSM and its usage in the neural networks?
